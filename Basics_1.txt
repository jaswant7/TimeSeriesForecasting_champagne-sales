Q-Q Plot:
 quantile: lines divide data into equally sized group. ex, 0.75 quantile line- 3 quarters of the points are less than it.
step1: give each point its own quantile
step2: normal curve or any other distribution.
step3: add the same no. of quantiles to the curve as you created for the data. For the normal curve, "equal sized groups" means that there is equal probability of observing a value within each group.
step4: plot q-q graph. Data quantiles vs normal quantiles.

Importance check for common distribution: assumption of a common distribution is justified or not when there are 2 data samples. If two samples do differ, it is also useful to gain some understanding of the differences.
